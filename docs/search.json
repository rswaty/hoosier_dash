    "text": "LANDFIRE, Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools, is a shared program between the wildland fire management programs of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service, the U.S. Department of the Interior, and The Nature Conservancy, that provides landscape-scale geo-spatial products, vegetation models and tools to support cross-boundary planning, management, and operations.\nLANDFIRE provides 25+ national geo-spatial layers (e.g. vegetation, fuel, disturbance, etc.), databases, and ecological models that are available to the public for the U.S. and insular areas.\nOur direct connection to the LANDFIRE Program offers a comprehensive range of nationwide geospatial data products that reflect current and historic conditions. These products also include ecosystem dynamic models that can be used for conservation, fire planning, and land management decisions.\nLANDFIRE’s mission is to provide agency leaders and managers with a common “all-lands” data set of vegetation and wildland fire/fuels information for strategic fire and resource management planning and analysis.\nThe Nature Conservancy supports LANDFIRE through\n\n“Advancing conservation outcomes through collaborative ecosystem science.”\n— Read more."
