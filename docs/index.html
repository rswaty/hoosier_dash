<p>We will use <a href="https://landfire.gov/" target="blank">LANDFIRE</a> products to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Map and summarize past and present ecosystems and ecosystem conditions</li>
<li>Explore historical disturbance regimes</li>
<li>Summarize patterns of change and management opportunities</li>
</ol>
<p>The following charts, maps, and graphs are based on current LANDFIRE products, however they are intended only as a starting point for further analysis.</p>
<p>This introduction will:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide context for the past and present ecosystem conditions for the Hoosier National Forest (within the proclamation boundary)</li>
<li>demonstrate the power of data visualization to explore ecological patterns and functions using LANDFIRE products</li>
<li>facilitate an understanding of historical and current conditions on a regional scale</li>
